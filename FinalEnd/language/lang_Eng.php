:T_STORY_TITLE:=The demise of our Earth
:T_STORY_1:=We had so much capabilities. What used to be unimaginable 20 years ago is reality today. Technologies are called our own that used to be unthinkable. There seemed to be no limits to our opportunities and to our power. We obtained everything we have ever wanted and we had been capable of archieving even more. 
Nowadays we travel to other planets by spaceships just like we went by bus all the years ago. This is just everyday's life now. We found new resources on other planets. So we were able to invent new products and technologies and send them to earth.
There was no human being that was not perfect. Genetic engineering reached its highest level. Babies were no longer just born but designed according to their parents wishes. The governments of all countries all over the world called it „evolution“. As a result of this so-called evolution, there was no longer a large variety of different humans but mankind recognized this error far too late.But can evolution really be the right word to call something not created by nature but by the human race.

:T_STORY_2:=Recreating humans and other beings was the latest progression i.e. Recreating, not cloning. The new humans are simply called Novus-Humanitas (abbr.: NH). You will not see any big difference to us when looking at them but their intelligence, their knowledge and their power exceed our by far. The only thing to figure them out was their eyes. The NH's do have deep blue or green ones. Few of them even had turquois ones. The NH's were hardly respected in society. Only a few of them did manage to climb the social ladder. For many people these creatures were only a dangerous try to play god, but the voices of those people were not heard. Either they were paid to be quiet or they disappeared without a trace.
:T_STORY_3:=When it came to hard work everything was done by machines. Not even housekeeping was done by humans anymore.
The only work done by humans was to lead, to administrate, to teach and to entertain. This was called progression as well. 
Nature changed too. You could hardly find any forests or grasslands. Either they became croplands or new buildings were constructed on them. Whole districts were exploited that hard and became deserts as a result. Weather also did its part. It was no longer predictable. This resulted in mankind working on the next big progress in history: controlling the weather. Scientists only could dream of it until now.

:T_STORY_4:=Not only this was the biggest step in our history, but an error with fatal consequences. Weather is not meant to be a toy in the hands of governments or scientists. Many years most nations were united and live side by side in peace. But one day a new resource was found on one of our new planets and nations again started struggeling to get it. Wars were fought again. NBC weapons, machines and recreated humans were used on battlefields and of course we made use of our latest technology, weather controlling.
:T_STORY_5:=One government hacked the weather server of another and obtained lone control of the systeme. Whole landscapes disappeared because of torrential rain or temperatures climbed on 40 degrees or more without a single raindrop at all. Even new ice ages were used for the battles.
So the new technologies used for war became weapons of mass destruction and destroyed our planet earth. Nowadays the planet is no longer habitable and is almost razed. The only chance to survivewas to leave earth and settle down on a new planet. 
Now each nation owns one planet. There is even trade between the nations again. 
But live will never be the same. We have all these new technologies but we lost something even more important: our minds.
